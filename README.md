# Airfoil-Self-Noise-Prediction
The NASA data set comprises different size NACA 0012 airfoils at various wind tunnel speeds and angles of attack. Our job is to predict the Airfoil through scaled sound pressure.
In this model, we have compared many regression algorithms and have found Random Forest Regressor as the best predictor.
